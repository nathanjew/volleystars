    <section class="about">
        <h2>About VolleyStars 🏐</h2>
        <p>
            VolleyStars is a student-led, not-for-profit after-school volleyball program created to introduce elementary
            school students to the sport of volleyball at an earlier age. Through years of competitive club experience
            and involvement in the volleyball community, it became clear to us that volleyball is often treated
            primarily as a
            high school sport. As a result, many students do not have the opportunity to try volleyball until after
            elementary school.
            <br><br>VolleyStars was created to change that. Our program teaches the fundamentals of volleyball in a fun,
            supportive, and inclusive environment where students can build confidence, teamwork, and friendships. By
            introducing volleyball earlier, we help students develop foundational skills that will prepare them for
            potential high
            school teams or competitive clubs if they choose to continue.
            <br><br>Our sessions are run by experienced volunteer coaches with over five years of experience in both
            volleyball and working with children. We aim to create a positive space where every child feels encouraged,
            supported, and excited to learn.

                    Hi, I'm Jacob!<br>I'm 16 years old in Grade 11, and I’ve been playing volleyball since I was 11. I
                    have competed at the competitive club level with 604 Volleyball
                    (14U and 15U), Apex Volleyball (16U and 17U), and have been a member of the David Thompson
                    Secondary School volleyball team since Grade 9. Through both club and school volleyball, I’ve
                    developed strong fundamentals, leadership skills, and a love for the game. I’m excited to
                    share my experience with younger athletes and help them build confidence, improve their skills, and
                    most importantly, have fun on the court!
